This package acts as a consensus mechanism, where many systems can participate in a decision-making process. They register their interest via an EntityQuery created in OnCreate. They can prevent entities from being un-Disabled until all systems agree. 

Just create a system that inherits from uhhhh ConsensusSystem I think. There is also a Flag IComponentData type that needs to be defined, its just a tag that the system will use. 

In the current state, a system must manually look for all indications of interest by a consensus system, and if the current entity (for example something loaded off disk like a Blueprint) matches the query, add a DynamicBuffer of blockers and add all the interested party flags into it. As the systems analyze the entity, they will remove their blocker from the buffer. Once the buffer is empty it should be removed and the Entity should be have its Disabled tag removed.
